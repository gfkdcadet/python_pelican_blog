<h3>ODSC Masterclass</h3>
<p>Dates: 3/1/2017 - 3/2/2017</p>
<p>This was a great two day conference to attend workshops from professionals in the industry. I highly recommend attending because the sessions are comprehensive, so
it can help tie different things together that you might have learned in isolation. It's also a great place to meet others in the industry and the instructors are top-notch.</p>
<p>I spent my first day with Jared Lander, the author of "R for Everyone", going through modeling techniques that quickly became advanced. R and R studio is a great easy to use programming language to pick up and it's great for statistical analysis. One of the topics Jared pointed out is how he likes to look at AIC and BIC scores for model feature evaluation rather than look at p-values. He hates p-values and says to often researches search for a data sample that provides a significant p-value, so that they say their findings are ready to be published.</p>
<p>I spent the whole second data going over different machine learning models using scikit-learn taught by Andreas C. Muller, who is one of the core developers behind
scikit-learn. So I was learning from the master, and among other things we covered grid search and data pipelines and using his approach/instruction, we went straight into applying the models rather than focusing extensively on preprocessing work. I highly recommend his book, "Introduction to Machine Learning with Python." It covers a lot and is not as basic as the title makes it sound.</p>  </div>
